# AR2Go

Web-based augmented reality markers compatible with [ARToolKit](http://www.artoolkit.org), crafted by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and delivered on top of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

No more printing markers! Just pull them up on your phone, tablet or web browser. Excellent for low-light settings.

## Getting started

__Requirements:__
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) _(optional)_
- A [Github](https://github.com/) for hosting _(optional)_

After downloading, run:
```
npm install
```
Install Ruby gems for live reloading:
```
bundle install
```

Run a local Jekyll server:
```
npm start
```

View your [local dev site](http://localhost:4000);

## Publishing
To build a static version of this site, run:
```
npm build
```
This will build a static HTML site ready to serve your AR markers.

Additionally, see [Using Jekyll as a static site generator with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) for more information on hosting that static site automagically on [Github](https://github.com/).
